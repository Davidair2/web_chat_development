# web_chat_development
The Travel Itinerary Chat Bot is a web application designed to create a personalised itinerary for a user looking to travel.
The user creates an account and logs in to the application. The user then enters the chat page where they can interact with the chat bot.
The chat bot will ask the user a series of questions to determine the user's travel preferences. 
The chat bot will then create a personalised itinerary for the user based on their preferences.
